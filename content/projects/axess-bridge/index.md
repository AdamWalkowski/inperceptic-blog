- Internal system for a leading company in the oil and gas industry with thousands of users worldwide. The system is provided as a comprehensive online service automating inspection and reporting processes for various clients.
- For more than 4 years I was part of small senior developers teams responsible for designing and developing Bridge system and migrating it to the cloud. Also built several applications in \"occasionally-connected\" pattern and reactive approach to communication.
- Bridge contains several independently served modules covering main tool to inspect structures or equipment like potential dropped objects, report findings, manage documents and put clients in control of their asset.
- The entire product is designed adaptive, so Bridge can easily be tailored to the unique needs of client operations, making it one of the most versatile and powerful inspection software in the oil and gas industry.
