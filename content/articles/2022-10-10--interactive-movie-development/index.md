- Project is a loose interactive screening of \"Lunch at the Gotham Cafe\" written by Stephen King. Co-produces with Film Spring Open Foundation, shoot in Krak√≥w, Poland.
- I have designed interactive video player and website as well as organize and leading video production team.
- Smoking kills is a combination of black comedy and horror. An awkward meeting of conflicted marriage in an exclusive restaurant unexpectedly turns into true nightmare.
- In the movie you become Stan and your aim is to find your good ending of the story. Every character can die or stay alive. The story depends on your decisions. As you watch select bloody-red areas which represent main character's decisions. When making a choice you always risk that something will go different than you expected.
